Thanks to **[gemma.cpp](https://github.com/google/gemma.cpp)** using **[Google Highway Library](https://github.com/google/highway)** to take advantage of portable SIMD for CPU inference, it can run smoothly on the kernel without any accelerator.

R**\n","\n","* **Popularity:**  Very popular in academia and for statistical analysis.\n","* **Strengths:**\n","    * **Statistical Focus:**  Built specifically for statistical computing and data visualization. \n","    * **Specialized Packages:**  A wide array of statistical packages for everything from time series analysis, Bayesian models, and more. \n","    * **Data Manipulation:**  Excellent for data manipulation and analysis with powerful data structures. \n","* **Use Cases:**\n","    * Statistical Modeling\n","    * Data Visualization (ggplot2 for highly customizable visualizations)\n","    * Research and Academia\n","    * Time series analysis\n","* **Why It's Popular:**  R excels in statistical modeling, data manipulation, and visualization, making it a powerful tool for data scientists who need strong statistical foundations.\n","\n","**3. SQL**\n","\n","* **Popularity:**  Essential for data management and querying.\n","* **Strengths:**\n","    * **Data Retrieval:**  Used to access, query, and manipulate data stored in relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).\n","    * **Structured Data:**  Ideal for working with structured data in databases. \n","* **Use Cases:**\n","    * Data Acquisition and Cleaning\n","    * Data Analysis and Reporting\n","    * Database Administration\n","* **Why It's Important:**  A core skill for any data scientist who works with structured data.\n","\n","**4. Julia**\n","\n","* **Popularity:**  A rising language with growing traction in the field.\n","* **Strengths:** \n","    * **Performance:**  Designed for high-performance computation (especially in scientific and engineering fields).\n","    * **Modern Language:**  Focuses on code clarity, readability, and efficiency.\n","    * **Growing Ecosystem:** A rapidly growing library ecosystem.\n","* **Use Cases:**\n","    * High-Performance Computing\n","    * Scientific Research\n","    * Data Analysis\n","* **Why It's Popular:**  Its performance advantage, combined with a modern syntax and growing community, makes it attractive for complex and computationally intensive data analysis.\n","\n","**Important Notes:**\n","\n","* **The Choice Depends on the Task:** The \"best\" language depends on the specific project or task.  \n","    * Python is great for most general data science work, while R might be the better choice for statistical analysis.  \n","    * SQL is a must-have for working directly with databases \n","* **Learning One Language First:**  It's usually more efficient to start with one language and become proficient in it before expanding into multiple languages. \n","\n","\n","Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any specific language or have other questions!"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["from IPython.display import display, Markdown\n","\n","for msg in history:\n","    if msg[\"role\"] == \"user\":\n","        display(Markdown(\"# Q: \" + msg[\"text\"]))\n","    else:\n","        display(Markdown(msg[\"text\"]))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ce099597","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.293212,"end_time":"2024-08-14T05:10:37.020188","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-08-14T05:10:36.726976","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Conclusions\n","\n","The output above shows that the AI assistant can extract information from a given post and answer questions asked by the user in the multi-turns conversation. Using the same approach, it could also be used for other tasks, such as AI customer service to provide FAQ Q&A services. All you need is to prepare an introductory document or just a FAQ list and set the role of the model in the prompt template.\n","\n","Although this approach cannot implement complex AI assistants as it only uses context prompts. However, due to the excellent CPU inference speed of **[gemma.cpp](https://github.com/google/gemma.cpp)**, it can run smoothly on **CPU-only devices**. This will bring extremely low deployment and operation costs, making **Gemma**'s excellent language processing and generation capabilities expected to be more and more widely used."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"databundleVersionId":7669720,"sourceId":64148,"sourceType":"competition"},{"modelId":3301,"modelInstanceId":22008,"sourceId":26145,"sourceType":"modelInstanceVersion"},{"modelId":76277,"modelInstanceId":72242,"sourceId":85981,"sourceType":"modelInstanceVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30684,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":1751.208859,"end_time":"2024-08-14T05:10:37.736684","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2024-08-14T04:41:26.527825","version":"2.5.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
